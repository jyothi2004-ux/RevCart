## 🎤 GREETING & TEAM (1.5 minutes)

"Hi everyone! I'm Aman, and this is my team - Dinesh, Jyothi, and Akshita.

We built **RevCart**, an online shopping app. Here's what each person did:

- **Aman (me)**: Home page, Checkout, Orders. Tested Cart component (42 tests).
- **Dinesh**: Best Sellers, New Arrivals. Tested Cart Service (40 tests).
- **Jyothi**: Login, Signup, Wishlist. Tested UI display.
- **Akshita**: Deals, Categories. Tested edge cases.

**We wrote 87 tests - 100% passing!** The app is production-ready."

---

## 🛠️ WHAT WE USED (1 minute)

"We built this with modern technologies:

- **Angular 18** - Main framework by Google
- **TypeScript** - Catches errors automatically
- **Signals** - Updates screen instantly when data changes
- **Tailwind CSS** - Beautiful responsive design
- **Services & Dependency Injection** - Organized, reusable code

All work together to make RevCart fast and professional."

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS (4 minutes)

*[Open the app]*

"Let me show you quickly:

**Step 1:** User visits home page → sees products

**Step 2:** Click category 'Fruits' → products load instantly (using Signals!)

**Step 3:** Add apple to cart →
- Item appears in cart ✓
- Cart count updates ✓
- Total price recalculates ✓
- Data saves (persists even after closing browser) ✓

**Step 4:** Go to Cart page →
- See items with images/prices
- + and - buttons change quantity instantly
- Delivery fee adds ($5.99)
- Total updates automatically

**Step 5:** Click Checkout →
- System checks: 'Are you logged in?' (Route Guard)
- If no → redirects to login
- If yes → shows checkout form

**Step 6:** Orders page → see all past orders, tracking status

*[Quick click-through demo if possible]*

That's the whole flow! Everything works instantly thanks to Signals technology."

## ✅ TESTING (2 minutes)

"We tested everything thoroughly:

**87 Total Tests - All Passing:**

- **40 tests** on Cart Service: Adding, removing, quantity, storage persistence, edge cases
- **42 tests** on Cart Component: Display, buttons, calculations, UI rendering
- **5 tests** on other components

**Why tests matter:**
- Users can't break the app
- All features work correctly
- Edge cases handled (weird scenarios work too!)
- Professional quality

When all tests pass = we're confident the app works!"

---

## 🏁 CONCLUSION (1-2 minutes)

"We didn't just build an app - we built it professionally:

✅ Complete feature set (search, cart, checkout, orders, admin)
✅ 87 tests prove quality
✅ Modern technology stack
✅ Team collaboration (4 people, clear responsibilities)
✅ Production-ready code

This could run a real business tomorrow!

**Questions?** We're ready to explain anything."
